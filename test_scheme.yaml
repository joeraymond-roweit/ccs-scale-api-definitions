                'Each release provides data about a single contracting process at a particular point in time. Releases can be used to notify users of new tenders, awards, contracts and other updates. Releases may repeat or update information provided previously in this contracting process. One contracting process may have many releases. A ''record'' of a contracting process follows the same structure as a release, but combines information from multiple points in time into a single summary.'
